# facebook-fake-news-extension
A Chrome extension that displays warnings on Facebook links to websites that may contain fake, false or misleading information.
The extension is intended as a proof-of-concept and was inspired by a similar one created by [Brian Feldman](https://github.com/bfeldman/fake-site-alert).

The [list of websites](https://github.com/mickaobrien/facebook-fake-news-extension/blob/master/warn.js#L2) is based on the article by [Melissa Zimdars](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10eA5-mCZLSS4MQY5QGb5ewC3VAL6pLkT53V_81ZyitM/preview).
